questions:
    1. do the records need to be in time order? e.g. could you have records at time 1,2,3,2,7,4 or do they have to be 1,2,3,4,5,6
    2. should main be in a different file?
    3. how do we read files in java lol
    4. can initialization take O(n)?
    5. can we use java.util/java.io libraries for this?
    6. can we use collections.sort() (probably not, right?)
