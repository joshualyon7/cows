questions:
    1. do the records need to be in time order? e.g. could you have records at time 1,2,3,2,7,4 or do they have to be 1,2,3,4,5,6
        - Assume not in any order
    2. should main be in a different file?
        - doesn't really matter, test it
    4. can initialization take O(n)?
        - maybe? might be something different depending on our solution
    5. can we use java.util/java.io libraries for this?
        - can use whatever built in data types we want
